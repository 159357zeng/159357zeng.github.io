I'm a graduate student at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include machine learning, embodied intelligence, and vision-language-action (VLA).

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Peng Li at the Intelligent Software Research Center, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
